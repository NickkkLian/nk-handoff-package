name: nk-handoff-package
description: Hand a line of work to an executor that has no context — another agent, a contractor, a future session — so that the work comes back checkable. Use when delegating a whole task or a round of work to a second agent, when receiving such work back, or when a brief keeps being re-explained. Builds a self-contained package (boundary written as orders, read-only reference layer with a sealed manifest, output layer with evidence and pending-sync templates, a receipt with an "unsure" section, a generic hand-back check with three exit states, project gates as a plugin), pins a trust root outside the package, and runs an acceptance checklist with a declared denominator. Not a project-management tool.

# Handoff package

**The hard part of delegating is not copying the files; it is moving the discipline with them, and
making the result checkable by someone who was not there.** Five delegations in a row taught the same
lesson: a brief says "don't push to the remote"; the executor, meaning well, syncs anyway; the receipt
says "all tests pass"; nobody can tell whether the checker that said so was the one you shipped.

> **Paths.** Commands in this skill start with `${…SKILL_DIR}`: this skill's own folder, the one that contains this SKILL.md. Claude Code fills it in. If your agent shows the placeholder as written (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and others), replace it with that folder's absolute path before you run the command. Left as it is, it expands to nothing and the path breaks.

## The shape

```
<task>/
  START.md                  boundary as orders · reading order · completeness check · what to hand back
  TASK.md                   this round only; replaced wholesale each round
  reference/                read-only inputs, sealed by MANIFEST.sha256
  output/
    handback_check.py       generic gates, one ruler for both sides (three exit states: 0 pass / 1 FAIL / 2 crashed)
                            (a copy of ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/handback_check.py, placed by handoff_init.py)
    project_gates.py        project-specific gates, checks(pkg, out) -> (location, description, is_fail)
    RECEIPT.md              what I did · how I verified · Unsure · Boundary crossings
    evidence/               one file per claim, first line "$ <re-run command>", then raw output
    work/                   the deliverable
    pending/{commit-messages,devlog,memory,decisions}/   records in template shape; the acceptor moves them
  .templates.sha256         unfilled templates are exempt by hash, not by name
  .acceptance.txt           the package declares its own acceptance steps (the denominator)
<task>-trust-root-<date>.txt   OUTSIDE the package: sha256 of START.md, both checkers, both manifests
```

## Procedure — handing out

1. `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/handoff_init.py <workspace> <task> [--form full|round|asset]`
   Refuses to touch a non-empty package. Then fill every `<<< FILL` slot in START.md and TASK.md.
2. Put the inputs in `reference/` and seal: `handoff_init.py <workspace> <task> --seal`.
3. Write `output/project_gates.py` for anything project-specific (thresholds, required files, forbidden
   imports). Each gate says what it cannot catch. Generic vs project-specific test: *would this still hold
   on another project?* If yes it belongs in the generic checker; if not, here.
4. Pin the trust root outside the package: `handoff_init.py <workspace> <task> --trust-root`.
   A package cannot vouch for itself: delete a file and its manifest line, edit text and re-hash, or
   replace the checker with `print("all pass")` — all three exit 0. The hashes live outside.
5. Keep your acceptance material outside too (this file, the trust root, expected answers). Ask of every
   file: does the executor need it to do the work, or do I need it to check the work?

## Procedure — receiving

1. `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/handoff_verify.py <package> --trust-root <file> [--source DIR]`
   runs the steps the package declared: trust root first (was the checker replaced?), then the hand-back
   check on a copy (raw output kept; crash ≠ FAIL ≠ pass), then drift (was the read-only layer altered;
   with `--source`, is it stale against the true source — staleness and tampering are different questions).
   It prints `planned N / ran M / failed K`; a step that could not run is NOT RUN, never a pass.
2. Replay `output/pending/` by hand into the real systems.
3. Dispatch an independent auditor on `output/evidence/` — someone who did not do the work and did not
   write the gates. Three verdicts, no fourth.
4. Stop rule: the audit loop ends when the deliverable's blocking items are resolved, not when nothing
   more can be found. Decide the threat model first: the executor is a colleague who makes mistakes, not an
   adversary; walls against an imagined adversary have no upper bound and once made the gate machinery
   2.3× the size of the deliverable it checked.

## Rules that came from incidents

- **Boundaries are orders, not capability statements.** "You have no write access to X" is either false
  (then it is a signpost to X) or redundant. Write "do not write to X" and say why.
- **Reason = collaboration.** A remote write from the executor does not fail; it overwrites a line of
  work silently. Saying so is what stops the helpful "let me sync this".
- **Empty is not green.** A fresh, unfilled package must FAIL its own check; twelve gates that pass on
  an untouched package are twelve gates that test nothing.
- **Templates are exempt by equation, not by name.** A file is skipped only if it is byte-identical to
  the shipped template; a renamed or half-filled template is checked.
- **The receipt's "Unsure" section is the most valuable line in the package.** Empty means unfilled, not
  confident; write "none" only when it is true.
- **Per-suite floors.** If the acceptance counts red cases across suites against one total, an entire
  suite can be deleted and the total still passes.
- **Cross-review the blind spots.** When two people build packages in parallel, the first question is
  "what is self-evident on your side?" — that is where the other one's package will be wrong.

## Boundaries

- The checks read shapes (a `$` line, a filled section, a hash). A plausible fabrication passes; the
  auditor and the evidence exist for that reason.
- Without `--source`, drift only proves the executor did not alter its inputs, not that the inputs are
  current.

## Provenance

Own practice, 2026-09: five delegations of whole projects to an outside agent, two of them cross-reviewed
for eight rounds each; a trust root added after three in-package ways of turning red into green were
measured; a stop rule added after an eleven-round audit loop. No external source.
